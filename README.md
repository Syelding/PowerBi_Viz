# PowerBi_Viz
PowerBi is an amazing tool to load, extract, and transform data. In this repository, I will be building on my PowerBi skills. You will see me create clear and beautiful vizualizations, utlize power query, manage relational databases, employ DAX, create bins and list and so much more.

##The Importance of DAX|
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) define custom calculations for calculated columns and measures. With DAX you can use Excel functions and also create functions that work with relational databses. In my viz, I first created new measures to find the total count of sales per customer and the sum of products sold. These insights are pivotal to any business because it shows you which products are doing well and it shows how much each customer is spending.
